# myNBA
For my CS50x final project, I created the ultimate web-based application for NBA fans, called myNBA. Users can search for any NBA player in history and add him to a locker that displays his image, name, and external Basketball-Reference link. Players can also be favorited, which provides users with the option to view them and their career stats in trading card style. Users can additionally search for any NBA team and download high quality logos right from the application.

## Description
The CS50 library was used in this project, which included features such as SQL and Beautiful Soup. The application is based on a Flask framework, and was written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Running Code
To run the application, use these commands:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=myNBA.py
$ flask run
```
